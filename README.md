<h1>Hi, I'm Tejas! <br/></h1></h2> IT Technician</a>, Home Sys Admin and a Cybersecurity ethusiast</a>, </a></h2>

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Home Lab Setup:</h2>

- <b>Home Lab Infrastructure Setup</b>
  - Setup homelab using open source softwares to upskill.
    
- <b>Proxmox</b>
  -  Proxmox hypervisor is the backbone of my homelab. This opensource hypervisor allows me to build the infrastructure I want. 
    
- <b>Windows Server 2022 </b>
  - Simulate Enterprise Environment using Windows Server2022. This hands-on experience has allowed me to gain in-depth knowledge of Windows Server 2022 features, including Active Directory, Group Policy, ADCS, DNS, and DHCP. Through this setup, I am gaining skills in server administration, virtualization, and network management, contributing to my comprehensive understanding of Windows-based infrastructure. 

- <b>PfSense router/firewall setup</b>
  -  I have implemented and configured pfSense, a powerful open-source firewall and routing platform. This deployment serves as a critical component in my network infrastructure, providing robust security features, including firewall rules, VPN capabilities, and traffic monitoring. Through pfSense, I've gained hands-on experience in network segmentation, traffic shaping, and currenty using it for learning intrusion prevention which will enhance my skills in network security and administration. This practical exposure demonstrates my commitment to creating secure and efficient network architectures, and it complements my broader expertise in IT infrastructure management.

- <b>Learn Linux</b>
  - As part of my ongoing commitment to learning and skill development, I have established an Ubuntu virtual machine (Learn Linux) within my home lab environment. This Ubuntu VM serves as a dedicated platform for hands-on experience with Linux operating systems. PfSense firewall is accessed through this VM and other systems in my homelab.
  
- <b>Open VPN</b>
  -  I've implemented OpenVPN to establish secure and reliable remote access to the lab environment. This strategic deployment allows me to connect to my home network securely from anywhere, providing a seamless and encrypted channel for accessing resources, services, and applications within the lab. Through the OpenVPN setup, I've gained practical experience in configuring VPN connections, managing certificates, and ensuring secure communication. 
    
- <b>SIEM Setup</b>
  - This setup is the backbone for learning Cyber Security. This system proactively monitor and analyze security events and incidents within my network. By leveraging Security Onion's capabilities, including log aggregation, intrusion detection, and real-time threat analysis, and with the help of tryhackme study course I am getting practical insights into equip myself with much needed Cyber Security skills.
